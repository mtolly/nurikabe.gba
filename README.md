A Game Boy Advance implementation of the [Nurikabe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurikabe_%28puzzle%29) puzzle.

Requires [devkitARM](http://devkitpro.org/) and `make` to build.
Uses Ruby (`erb`) as a preprocessor (but you don't need it just to compile).
Run `make` to build.

Use the d-pad to move around, A to place dots (mark as white), and B to fill in squares as black.
